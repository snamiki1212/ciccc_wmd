      Victory seemed unlikely. Mount Saint Michael were two sets down and St. Leo’s certainly had the
      upper hand in the third set, dominating 9 points to 2. Each time St. Leo’s scored, they pounded the
      ground in unison, further intimidating an already shaky Claremorris team. So how, in these
      circumstances, did they snatch victory from the jaws of almost certain defeat?
