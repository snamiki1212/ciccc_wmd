          <p>
            Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] (About this soundlisten); 14 March
            1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist[5] who developed the theory of relativity, one
            of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics).[3][6] His work is also known for its
            influence on the philosophy of science.[7][8] He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy
            equivalence formula E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".[9] He received the
            1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of
            the law of the photoelectric effect",[10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory.

          <h2>Life and career</h2>

          <p>
            Albert Einstein was born in Ulm, in the Kingdom of Württemberg in the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.
            At age 13, when he had become more seriously interested in philosophy (and music),[27] Einstein was
            introduced to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, and Kant became his favorite philosopher, his tutor stating:
            "At the time he was still a child, only thirteen years old, yet Kant's works, incomprehensible to ordinary
            mortals, seemed to be clear to him."

          <p>
            By 1908, he was recognized as a leading scientist and was appointed lecturer at the University of Bern. The
            following year, after he gave a lecture on electrodynamics and the relativity principle at the University of
            Zurich, Alfred Kleiner recommended him to the faculty for a newly created professorship in theoretical
            physics. Einstein was appointed associate professor in 1909.[78]

            Einstein received numerous awards and honors, and in 1922, he was awarded the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics
            "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric
            effect". None of the nominations in 1921 met the criteria set by Alfred Nobel, so the 1921 prize was carried
            forward and awarded to Einstein in 1922.[10]
