                  Tokyo City (東京市, Tōkyō-shi) was a municipality in Japan and part of Tokyo-fu which existed from 1 May
                  1889 until its merger with its prefecture on 1 July 1943.[1] The historical boundaries of Tokyo City
                  are now occupied by the 23 Special Wards of Tokyo. The new merged government became what is now Tokyo,
                  also known as the Tokyo Metropolis, or, ambiguously, Tokyo Prefecture.

                  the medieval city of Edo, seat of the Tokugawa government, was renamed Tokyo, and the offices of Tokyo
                  Prefecture (-fu) were opened.[1] The extent of Tokyo Prefecture was initially limited to the former
                  Edo city, but rapidly augmented to be comparable with the present Tokyo Metropolis.

                  the Meiji government's reorganization of local governments[2] subdivided prefectures into counties or
                  districts (gun, further subdivided into towns and villages, later reorganized similar to Prussian
                  districts) and districts or wards (ku) which were in ordinary prefectures cities as a whole, e.g.
                  today's Hiroshima City (-shi) was then Hiroshima-ku; the three major cities of Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto
                  were each subdivided into several such wards. In Tokyo Prefecture, this created 15 wards (listed
                  below) and six counties/districts.[3]

                  the central government created the legal framework for the current system of cities (shi)[4] that
                  granted some basic local autonomy rights – with some similarities to Prussia's system of local
                  self-government as Meiji government advisor Albert Mosse heavily influenced the organization of local
                  government.[5] But under a special imperial regulation,[6] Tokyo City, like Kyoto City and Osaka City,
                  initially did not maintain a separate mayor; instead, the (appointed) governor of Tokyo Prefecture
                  served as mayor of Tokyo City.

                  The Tokyo city council/assembly (Tōkyō-shikai) was first elected in May 1889. Each ward also retained
                  its own assembly. City and prefectural government were separated in 1898.,[3] and the government began
                  to appoint a separate mayor of Tokyo City in 1898, but retained ward-level legislation, which
                  continues to this day in the special ward system.

                  From 1926, the mayor was elected by the elected city council/assembly from its own ranks. The city
                  hall of Tokyo was located in the Yūrakuchō district, on a site now occupied by the Tokyo International
                  Forum.[7] Tokyo became the second-largest city in the world (population 4.9 million) upon absorbing
                  several outlying districts in July 1932, giving the city a total of 35 wards.[1]

                  became a Cabinet minister reporting directly to the Prime Minister. This system remained in place
                  until 1947 when the current structure of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government was formed.[1]
